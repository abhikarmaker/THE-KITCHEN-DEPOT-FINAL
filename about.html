						<ul>

							<li>Customers are attracted to my business because of our products; which is literally the ability to cook all day long without noticing back.</li>
							<li>A "Service Warranty" is a warranty, guarantee, extended warranty or extended guarantee, maintenance service contract of 1 year that provides 	protection against the cost of repair, replacement or maintenance of a consumer product, in return for the payment of a premium. </li>

				<h3 class=text-center>Our guarantee</h3>
					<article>
						<ul>
							<li>100% Satisfaction Guarantee.</li>
							<li>Instead of simply offering a customer’s money back or giving them a chance to try before they buy, you create an offer that’s advantageous to both the customer and your business.</li>
							<li>A 100% satisfaction guarantee not only guarantees that the customer will be happy, but also guarantees that you’ll get another chance to save the sale by offering an exchange or 2nd chance effort.</li>
							<li><b>From a customer’s perspective, you’re not only reducing risk, but you’re reducing it almost completely. You’re guaranteeing a result, which as we talked about earlier, is the most important aspect of the conversion. You’re guaranteeing their satisfaction, which in turn negates the opportunity for regret.</b></li>
